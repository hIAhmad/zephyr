compatible: "zephyr,ram-disk"

include: ["base.yaml", "memory-region.yaml"]

properties:
  disk-name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Disk name.

  sector-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536]
    description: |
      Disk sector size in bytes.

  sector-count:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Number of sectors.

  ram-region:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Optional phandle to the memory region to be used as a RAM disk,
      if not used, and 'disk-image' property is also not used, a local buffer is
      defined for each disk instance. Use it with caution as it makes memory
      contents easily accessible.

  disk-image:
    type: string
    description: |
      Optional path of a disk image, on the build host system, to be used as
      backing store of a RAM disk. Make sure that 'sector-size' and 'sector-count'
      are set to correct values such that 'sector-size' matches the corresponding
      value used in the existing filesystem (if any) on the disk image and the
      computed disk size (sector-size x sector-count) matches the size of the disk
      image in bytes.
